When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
What you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas .
Now , where do you find such Goldilocks conditions ?
But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
Each rung contains information .
It &apos;s accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work .
Terrible news for the dinosaurs , but great news for our mammalian ancestors , who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs .
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa , but then you see humans migrating into new environments , into desert lands , into jungles , into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia — tough , tough environment — into the Americas , into Australasia .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
I was not an activist .
How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
&quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
Many of them drown .
For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
( Applause )
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
Thank you very much .
In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days , but secretly , I hate him .
Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
Here &apos;s my clock .
It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
A couple of hours later , the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass , and a different smell will be emitted .
So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
I thought my idea was pretty good , but his idea is genius , and at the time , I knew his idea was better than mine , but I just couldn &apos;t explain why .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
( Video ) Jinsop Lee : Hey , my name &apos;s Jinsop , and today , I &apos;m going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses . Hey !
Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
Now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my — I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
Many people told me a big part of the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise .
You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
OK , next , clubbing .
OK , here what I found interesting was that taste is at four , and many respondents told me it &apos;s because of the taste of drinks , but also , in some cases , kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience .
These people I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking .
Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
Here I &apos;ll quote one of my students who said , &quot; Sex is so good , it &apos;s good even when it &apos;s bad . &quot;
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
This is an iron , you know , for your clothes , to which I added a spraying mechanism , so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent , and your clothes will smell nicer , but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable .
We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
So in conclusion , I &apos;ve found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life , and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs .
Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
Here &apos;s the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks .
And the best way to do that is with free candy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
And she said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just stand here and compliment each other ?
If you hear your name called , go and pick up your gift and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?
What could go wrong ?
So behave next year — someone might say something nice about you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , as I &apos;m describing this you , you probably know I remember this really well . ( Laughter )
But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
And without the humor .
That &apos;s one version .
Bill Gates came to my hometown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them : &quot; &quot; By age 25 , I will build the biggest company in the world , and that company will buy Microsoft . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world — domination , right ?
And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad handwriting , but I did highlight some key words .
You get the idea .
I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
I didn &apos;t even start .
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
It &apos;s because every time I had a new idea , every time I wanted to try something new , even at work — I wanted to make a proposal , I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old .
I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be Bill Gates , you &apos;ve got to start sooner or later , right ?
When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
And that rejection hurt me .
But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection ?
So this is where I went online and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
( Laughter ) I searched , &quot; &quot; How do I overcome the fear of rejection ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from .
Then I came up with a bunch of &quot; &quot; rah-rah &quot; &quot; inspirational articles about &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take it personally , just overcome it . &quot; &quot; Who doesn &apos;t know that ?
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Rejection Therapy &quot; &quot; was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur .
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection , and every day get rejected at something , and then by the end , you desensitize yourself from the pain .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this .
Day One ...
( Laughter ) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life — hair on the back of my neck standing up , I was sweating and my heart was pounding .
And I got there and said , &quot; Hey , sir , can I borrow 100 dollars from you ? &quot;
And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; Then I turned around , and I just ran .
( Laughter ) I felt so embarrassed .
But because I filmed myself — so that night I was watching myself getting rejected , I just saw how scared I was .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I love your burgers , I love your joint , and if you guys do a burger refill , I will love you guys more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , I &apos;ll tell my manager about it , and maybe we &apos;ll do it , but sorry , we can &apos;t do this today . &quot; &quot; Then I left .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; Hey , can I know why ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard .
( Arabic ) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan . In the Name of Allah , the most Gracious , the most Merciful .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a businessman .
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
My mother had 16 pregnancies .
From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
Day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
While I was completing my education , my country was invaded by Russia .
And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
My family was in a refugee camp .
So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
when I went day-to-day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do .
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
So it was a very devastating situation .
At that moment , we talk about momentum .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
And also , by Russia invading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
I asked .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mullah .
I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Run away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
And of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but I was really shaking up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking Pashto .
They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offered them tea again , and they took a sip and they left .
By that time , my staff poured into my office .
With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bodyguard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
There is no doubt in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
That tells you that education transforms people .
When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
But you know what happened to my country .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
If you have these few things with you , you will accomplish .
We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
And you see , some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten , some they use to attract prey , but all of it , from an artistic point of view , is just positively amazing .
Here we &apos;re going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles — he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
Now , Roger spooked him , so he took off in a cloud of ink , and when he lands , the octopus says , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been seen .
Customer : I &apos;d like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39 .
Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
( Applause ) ( Foot stomp ) ( Music ) ( Roar ) Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
Ideas can spark a movement .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
Our magazines are read by millions .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that to this day I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night , except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
This is the Amnok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate , back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police , and brought to the police station for interrogation .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me , and answer the questions .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report . She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
But many can be caught by the Chinese police , and repatriated .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea .
So , ironically , I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily , he believed me .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month .
But soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again , in the capital of Laos .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail , just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM , and he paid the rest of the money for my family , and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .

This is how the rooftop looks .
And why did we design this ?
The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
( Laughter ) Feeding time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no boundary .
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
But here , just they leave and come back .
It &apos;s a natural process .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
You know , it &apos;s completely open .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide classrooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a washbasin .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one skylight .
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
They need to get some injury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Third thing : probing the very small .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
You were lied to .
Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
Here is an image .
Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .
( Applause )
I &apos;m a little bit lost , and it &apos;s finally time to make a real connection .
Who am I ?
( Drums ) I &apos;m a single white male , 45 years of age .
I love animals .
Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
Now , to be clear , North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speciality consultation , and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help .
I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla didn &apos;t have a torn aorta , evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur , make sure that this California sea lion &apos;s paricardium wasn &apos;t inflamed , and in this picture , I &apos;m listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesaving , collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained 700 cc &apos;s of fluid from the sac in which this lion &apos;s heart was contained .
And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
Now most of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : congestive heart failure , brain tumors , leukemia , diabetes , arthritis , ALS , breast cancer , even psychiatric syndromes like depression , anxiety , compulsions , eating disorders and self-injury .
Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad — I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory — learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wake-up call for me .
So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
Physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook .
I feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the dice , in a bride who &apos;d been left at the alter .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
Veterinarians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos , from to deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
Some animal patients also harm themselves .
Shouldn &apos;t this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury ?
Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the foal , refusing to nurse , and in some instances , kick the foal , even to death .
But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
Oxytocin is the bonding hormone , and this leads to renewed interest , on the part of the mare , in her foal .
Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D. &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
Of course , most physicians don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Homo sapiens , but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amphibians , reptiles , fish and birds .
But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
A physician . ( Laughter ) Closing the gap has become a passion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA , where we &apos;re bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents .
And through Zoobiquity conferences , where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
At Zoobiquity conferences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher ; how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school .
In the United States and now internationally , at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
After all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physicians to embrace our patients &apos; and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species-spanning approach to health .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
Thank you .
I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
No adults believed I was serious .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
You probably won &apos;t .
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
This is a problem we have to solve .
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
They put it online for free .
It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
He finds a local sporting team .
He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
My challenge instead is this .
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
So I was on a national television prime-time show .
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phew .
( Applause ) Having brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shocking news for me .
I knew nothing about cancer .
In Western cultures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you disappear in a way .
Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
And everyone changes as well .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
Doctors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And in the meanwhile , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer .
These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you .
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who waits . &quot;
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but classically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
While I was in the hospital , I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it .
It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
A cure , whichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone .
So I created a website , which is called La Cura , on which I put my medical data , online .
I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cura — La Cura in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
In our Western cultures , it means eradicating or reversing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the Mediterranean , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
And , it worked .
The La Cura website went viral .
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails , social networking — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cura .
For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
Or , as artist Patrick Lichty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse .
Now you can have my cancer , too !
( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
With all this information and support , I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , oncologists , and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving , which is very important .
And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
&#91; Surgery &#93; The follow-up MRIs showed , luckily , little to no growth of the cancer .
So I was able to take my time and choose .
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of La Cura .
What are the outcomes ?
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-grade glioma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid .
Obviously , there were .
&#91; Open &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
Doctors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually consult when they think about cancer .
I &apos;m a self-founding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cure for me , but for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit , so I decided to make the app .
A lot of times it &apos;s because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also .
And then Apple released the iPhone , and with it , the iPhone software development kit , and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app .
A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
So we &apos;re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they &apos;d like .
So this is a resource to teachers , and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it . ( Laughter )
I &apos;d like to get into Android programming and development , and I &apos;d like to continue my app club , and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others .
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s closet doors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s closet , and there was not a secret magical land there .
Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
And the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , liminal , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
It was going to be the highlight of our store .
Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
There &apos;s a quarterly that &apos;s published with just writing that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
Eliot Gannon ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm — ( Laughter ) — that says that due to a change in customs laws , their whale has been held up in Sognefjord , which is a very lovely fjord , and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for a little while . It digresses . ( Laughter )
Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
&#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his &quot; &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; &quot; speech .
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
I was born in a family full of colors .
My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
She has two sisters .
One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the beige side , like a pancake .
( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
Outside home , however , things were different soon .
Color had many other meanings .
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
Years later I married a Spaniard .
But not any Spaniard .
I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
What will be the color of your children ?
As you can understand , this is my last concern .
But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
And that is how Humanae was born .
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
I portray the subjects in a white background .
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pantone .
I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
The snowball started to roll .
The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
just happened .
And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
In Paris , from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter .
And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
We all together build Humanae .
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
Or does it have to do with our origin , nationality or bank account ?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me , &quot; &quot; Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence , as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway .
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
Perhaps we should stop .
Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m Massiel .
I &apos;m a Dominican-Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
Just to show you some examples , illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
It &apos;s a collection of faces .
Researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
teachers .
They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
All the frustration , fear and loneliness that I once felt ...
becomes love .
The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experimental education program .
It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
That &apos;s a breach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about warfare .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .

It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , because six months ago , I saved his life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; He was in a car wreck , and I pulled him out , gave him CPR , and I saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , to me , human communities depend upon a diversity of talent , not a singular conception of ability .
But as we just heard in this last session , there &apos;s such competition now to get into kindergarten — to get to the right kindergarten — that people are being interviewed for it at three .
People have very different aptitudes .
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
( Laughter ) Which , if I remember my high school Spanish , means something like , &quot; &quot; Enough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No MAS works . It &apos;s very simple .
When they &apos;re born , babies continue to smile — initially , mostly in their sleep .
The finding supported Darwin &apos;s theory , by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain , in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .
So whenever you want to look great and competent , reduce your stress or improve your marriage , or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost , or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn &apos;t worn for ages , or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer , healthier , happier life , smile .
Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
Students lack perseverance .
They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
This is really destructive .
David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
It applies equally to math .
Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
It means to play softly .
If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .
Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
This is my drawing of a p-tree , which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never reach complete silence .
I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language , ASL , plus a bit of my own background .
French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s , and as time went by , mixed with local signs , it evolved into the language we know today as ASL .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
And I believed it to be true .
Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
Sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
As a Deaf person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
So how is it that I understand sound ?
Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
I learn and mirror that behavior .
At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
Thus I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
&quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the potato-chip bag ! &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t burp , and when you &apos;re eating , make sure you don &apos;t scrape your utensils on the plate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I term &quot; &quot; sound etiquette . &quot; &quot; Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does .
I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound .
And I &apos;m always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
TBD , to be decided .
TBC , to be continued .
TBA , to be announced .
And you notice the staff — there are no notes contained in the lines .
That &apos;s because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears .
In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
Yet for me , signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
During this summer , I visited different museums and gallery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there .
At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
there was no visual art , everything was auditory .
Now sound has come into my art territory .
Is it going to further distance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
It could be felt tactually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and unlearn .
I started creating a new body of work .
And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received .
I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social currency .
In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me .
I chose to be empowered .
There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relevancy in society today .
So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpreters .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices hold value and currency .
Ironically , by borrowing out their voices , I &apos;m able to maintain a temporary form of currency , kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate .
If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency .
So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper .
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
They &apos;re both highly spatial and highly inflected — meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds .
I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works .
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano — such as facial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano — English is a linear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time .
However , ASL is more like a chord — all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL .
If just one of those keys were to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
In ASL , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .
For example , take the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
I &apos;m looking at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — busted . ( Laughter )
Uh-oh .
What are you looking at ?
Aw , stop .
( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens ? &quot;
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun rises and sets .
This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visually it looks like a piece of music .
All ... day .
I feel the same holds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
This is ALL-NIGHT , represented in this drawing .
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; overnight , &quot; ( Sings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two . ( Laughter )
This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .
For example , 1H is one hand , 2H is two hand , present tense happens closest and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back .
So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Then &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; Common time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure .
Yet when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So notice RH : right hand , LH : left hand .
We have the staff across the head and the chest .
&#91; Head : RH , Flash claw &#93; &#91; Common time &#93; &#91; Chest : LH , Flash claw &#93; I &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the &quot; &quot; flash claw . &quot; &quot; Can you please follow along with me ?
Everybody , hands up .
Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time .
Yes , got it .
That means &quot; &quot; to fall in love &quot; &quot; in International &#91; Sign &#93; .
( Laughter ) International &#91; Sign &#93; , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world .
The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
( Laughter ) Now the third — please follow along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
&quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
( Laughter ) Notice how all three signs are very similar , they all happen at the head and the chest , but they convey quite different meanings .
So it &apos;s amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving , just like music is .
However , in this day and age , we live in a very audio-centric world .
And just because ASL has no sound to it , it automatically holds no social currency .
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency — without sound .
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be deaf to learn ASL , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
ASL is such a rich treasure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
( Applause ) Thank you .

We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there — well , we &apos;re sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas , ( Laughter ) trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .

Tree bark is particularly good because it &apos;s nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking — humans are pattern-seeking animals .
But who does it really look like ? The Virgin Mary ? ( Laughter )
It was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; &quot; Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a love story — she &apos;s sort of the Norah Jones of the UK — about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth .
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
I saw my father wither away and die .
In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
I was not uncommon .
Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
Hope kept me alive .
Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
I thought more people would help me .
But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
Hope brought me to America .
But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
And I — oh , gosh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
AH : Sure , please .
JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
Thank you .

How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
Had they consumed colored drinks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
In fact , she need not have hurried .
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
George frankly preferred numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
Alice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take skill and practice , too .
If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
They think of him as a leader .
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

My family ate one meal per day , at night .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
So I went to a library .
( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
I had never seen an airplane before .
So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates .
What do you do with certificates ?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Privacy is implied .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
When I married my wife , I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time .
Secondly , the world is now so noisy , ( Noise ) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily , it &apos;s just hard to listen ; it &apos;s tiring to listen .
And the art of conversation is being replaced — dangerously , I think — by personal broadcasting .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed .
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate , so that you can hear the quiet again .
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
So , mundane sounds can be really interesting — if you pay attention .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
I had a newspaper clipping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
My dad came out again .
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
The road turned into the jungle .
And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
( Applause )
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
Take nothing : do no harm .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
So the equation is conceptual .
Still it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
Linear : take , make , waste .
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
More carpet per man-hour .
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measured our progress very rigorously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
We call it Cool Carpet .
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
It is practical , and pretty too .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
We call this Mission Zero .
And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
Here is the business case for sustainability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
We literally gained market share .
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in execution .
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
A wise friend introduced us two .
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
Knowing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
Begin , I will .
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
