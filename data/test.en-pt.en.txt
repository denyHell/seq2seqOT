By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
Thank you very much .

People tell you this one thing — will make your life complete .
So you , you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street .
Then one day you wake up , and they tell you &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a queen , &quot; &quot; but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings .

The one you love , they love you — oh yeah — until the end of time .
But lose your edge or lose your cool , they will drop you like a dime .
Everyone is crowding &apos; round when fortune is your friend .
When your luck is running out , you &apos;re all alone again .

Well , maybe I &apos;m just cynical , and all these words are lies , but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise .
But caution makes you hesitate , and hesitate you &apos;re lost , so take your opportunities and never count the cost .

Thank you so much .
People returning to work after a career break : I call them relaunchers .
Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers .
Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition , and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers , especially if they &apos;ve been out for a long time .
Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks .
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O &apos;Connor took a five-year career break early in her career .
Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it .
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
She was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
I met Tracy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
Expect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce .
And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
Or here I am in the kitchen .
But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
My background is in finance , and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children .
So I was afraid I &apos;d go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again .
I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
Think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
On the flip side , I speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
The first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
Now , I can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a temporary condition .
I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
I found PowerPoint much more challenging , but now I use PowerPoint all the time .
I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
It &apos;s the relauncher &apos;s responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship-like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
I saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
So I wrote a report about what I was seeing , and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The 40-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there for that title , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns .
And then , courtesy of Fox Business News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; The 50-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals .
These internships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers .
Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews , and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over .
This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
Think about how far we have come .
This is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transitioners too .
In fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program .
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retiree internship program .
Different pool , same concept .
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro .
Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
Well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
This was in the fall of 2011 .
Tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
Well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Tracy could handle .
Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy &apos;s been promoted .
Tracy &apos;s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer .
Now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
Thank you .

Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Huh . Hang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?

It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at the ACLU as the organization &apos;s science advisor .
I really , really loved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged .
Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights .
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — super interesting .
So Chris cut right to the chase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biobanking , and ...
&quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
Gene patent proponents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t patent the gene in your body , we patented an isolated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated .
And the patents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
Allowing patent holders , often private companies , to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients .
Consider Abigail , a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome , a serious heart condition that , if left untreated , can result in sudden death .
The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
During that time , Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT .
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not patent eligible .
You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that codes for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
As we delved into this issue , we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years .
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo , the biotech industry had grown up around this practice , and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress , and had gone absolutely nowhere .
So the bottom line : courts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to overturn these patents .
Now , neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
So we set out to build our case .
Now , patent cases tend to be : Company A sues Company B over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case — more like a civil rights case .
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation .
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics , a company that &apos;s based in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Myriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes .
Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer .
Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States .
It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop .
It charged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
It has been estimated that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
Kathleen &apos;s sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
The test was negative .
The family was relieved .
But two years later , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer .
It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result .
Had Eileen received the proper result , Kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
Once we settled on Myriad , we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems .
We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs : genetic counselors , geneticists who had received cease and desist letters , advocacy organizations , four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals , and individual women who either couldn &apos;t afford Myriad &apos;s test , or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not , as a result of the patents .
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts , trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately .
And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
So isolating DNA — it &apos;s like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t patent it , it &apos;s still gold .
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet .
In March 2010 , Judge Sweet issued his opinion — 152 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
In reading the opinion , we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case .
I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
He was not just a scientist — he had a PhD in molecular biology .
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
And here things got really interesting .
First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad &apos;s side .
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office , the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible .
This was a really big deal , totally unexpected .
So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
Sort of .
Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
But the two judges who ruled against us , did so for completely different reasons .
The first one , Judge Lourie , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
And when you petition the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer .
Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph , like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses , &quot; wherein this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives , and it agreed to hear ours .
The day of the oral argument arrives , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse .
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces : our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories , the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical , patient advocacy , environmental and religious organizations , who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case .
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-discoverer of DNA himself , James Watson , who had submitted a brief to the court , where he referred to gene patenting as &quot; &quot; lunacy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake .
The argument itself was riveting .
Chris argued brilliantly .
But for me , the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA , through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon .
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day , but I could never have anticipated the outcome : nine to zero .
&quot; &quot; A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature , and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated .
And furthermore , Myriad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes .
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail , Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need .
A few weeks after the court issued its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan , a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case .
I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
A little luck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bridged , the alliances that we created , that made pigs fly .
Thank you .
&quot; &quot; When the crisis came , the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is also a strong belief , which I share , that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis . &quot; &quot; Now , you &apos;ve probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism .
The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank .
The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions ?
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
But there &apos;s an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity .
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics .
Then , predictions can be made and tested .
We &apos;re actually really lucky that this works , because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe .
So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts : swarms of birds or fish , ant colonies , ecosystems , brains , financial markets .
Interestingly , complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations , so the usual physics approach doesn &apos;t really work here .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
Well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction .
This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions .
So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
So what equations are for physics , complex networks are for the study of complex systems .
This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics , biology , computer science , the social sciences , but what about economics ?
Where are economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
And the links represent the shareholding relations , so shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B.
And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
Now , you may think that no one looked at this before because ownership networks are really , really boring to study .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
This is a lot of data , and because we wanted to find out &quot; who rules the world , &quot; we decided to focus on transnational corporations , or &quot; &quot; TNCs , &quot; &quot; for short .
These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
In the next step , we built the network around these companies , so we took all the TNCs &apos; shareholders , and the shareholders &apos; shareholders , etc . , all the way upstream , and we did the same downstream , and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links .
So you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players , and in the center , there &apos;s this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies .
So you have the suburbs and the periphery , you have a center , like a financial district , then the core will be something like the tallest high-rise building in the center .
36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only , but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs .
OK , so now we analyzed the structure , so how does this relate to the control ?
This is very much in the sense of Max Weber &apos;s idea of potential power , which is the probability of imposing one &apos;s own will despite the opposition of others .
Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
So similarly , the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes .
Now remember , we started out with 600,000 nodes , so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent .
And we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules .
It &apos;s an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system , so it &apos;s probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy .
So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I conceptualize this metaphor , what I picture is straight out of a cartoon — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s walking down the sidewalk , without realizing it , he crosses over an open manhole , and he just plummets into the sewer below .
Falling is accidental , it &apos;s uncontrollable .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
So , in love , we fall .
We &apos;re struck .
We swoon .
We burn with passion .
Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
Our hearts ache , and then they break .
So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
( Laughter ) They do .
My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; which is the past participle of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; grievous affliction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associate the word &quot; &quot; smite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the Old Testament .
In the Book of Exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God .
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So , how did this happen ?
And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
These are difficult questions , but I have some theories .
And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as madness .
When I first started researching romantic love , I found these madness metaphors everywhere .
The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness .
These are just a few examples .
William Shakespeare : &quot; Love is merely a madness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; As You Like It . &quot; &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche : &quot; There is always some madness in love . &quot;
&quot; Got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyoncé Knowles . ( Laughter )
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
I can remember one moment in particular .
I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America , and I was watching the person I love walk out the door .
And it was late , it was nearly midnight , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he threw his things in the bag and stormed out .
While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
I just sat there .
And then I burst into tears .
But despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I longed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was irrational and furious and devastated , and weirdly enough , I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
This really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; Crazy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
We made up .
And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
This must be a real romance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like madness , and of course , it met that expectation very well .
But loving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
In fact , there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal , because , neurochemically speaking , romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished .
This is true .
This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder .
( Laughter ) Yes , and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression .
So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , desperate to hear from the guy I loved .
I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then I did not need their friendship .
And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , then I would prove how much I loved him .
And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
This is the real madness , because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward , but we talk about love as if this is true .
Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neurochemically speaking , going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal , which I find reassuring .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
That sounds terrible .
( Laughter ) To reconcile this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
If we were more assertive , more open-minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
In their book , &quot; &quot; Metaphors We Live By , &quot; &quot; linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphors .
They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling prophecies .
Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails : effort , compromise , patience , shared goals .
These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , casual , polyamorous , non-monogamous , asexual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
So if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
Love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
And love involves both joy and pain .
Ultimately , each experience of love is different .
When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
When 14-year-old Juliet first meets — or , when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
Where is she ?
Right ?
And just as a refresher , at this point in the play , act three of five , Romeo is not dead .
He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been banished from the city .
I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
It &apos;s still hard .
Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
This isn &apos;t easy , either .
But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s affection .
Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collaborators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Or here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this auditorium , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from mold to mushrooms to flying bears . ( Laughter )
And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
What we have here is one exploit file .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
Know that China believes in the market and the state .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
Our thinking is backwards .
We should be celebrating play .
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
Here comes the Prime Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy Cuddy : So a handshake , or the lack of a handshake , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
So when we think of nonverbals , we think of how we judge others , how they judge us and what the outcomes are .
We make ourselves small .
I notice a couple of things about this .
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol , and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol .
So we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
Here are a couple more .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and feeling sort of shut down .
They &apos;re being judged also , and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback , so they look like this .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s driving it ?
So when I tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; &quot; It feels fake . &quot; &quot; Right ?
And that really resonated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward , and I had been withdrawn from college , and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations , which was very traumatic .
It took me four years longer than my peers , and I convinced someone , my angel advisor , Susan Fiske , to take me on , and so I ended up at Princeton , and I was like , I am not supposed to be here .
I am an impostor .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my gosh , I &apos;m doing it .
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who I had said , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; &quot; came into my office . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
And tomorrow you &apos;re going to fake it , you &apos;re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know — ( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . &quot; &quot; You know ? And she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there . ( Laughter ) She comes back to me months later , and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it , she had actually faked it till she became it .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this . ( Laughter ) Give it away . Share it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power .
( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
This is a time of need .
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
They begin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
Student : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
They say no .
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
What was the feedback like ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
So , Amy ?
AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
And then you ask , why economists ?
Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
The year is 1800 .
A curious little invention is being talked about .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
You take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
They all have faces .
Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
And that &apos;s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the microscope itself .
Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes .
So what is a Foldscope ?
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
So , now you think , how is that possible ?
I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
It starts with a single sheet of paper .
What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
This paper has no instructions and no languages .
There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an XY stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
So this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
You pop this in .
There is an XY stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
Right there .
All from the simple setup that I actually described .
So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
This also shows you how the projection scope works .
You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
Can we get the lights back on again ?
So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sheet of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A4 sheet of paper .
These are the three stages that you actually see .
And the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
There are some light sources .
And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
There it is , and it survives .
So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
We are starting at the end of the summer .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
And I want to leave you with this picture .
I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
Thank you .

Most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
Because I want to show points of interest .
No , no . The other way .
Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
OK , never mind .
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
I think this is a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
Okay , so fine .
So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
So this is a huge practical problem .
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people I had ever met .
Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acquainted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
My idea is : no ! No !
Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
They know .
What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
And it sent me back .
Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
Right ? This is simple physics .
All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
I had just driven home , it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter , I had been visiting my friend , Jeff , across town , and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees — and don &apos;t bother asking if that &apos;s Celsius or Fahrenheit , minus 40 is where the two scales meet — it was very cold .
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
I thought about calling a locksmith — at least I had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .
This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy .
( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport check-in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my passport . ( Laughter )
So I raced home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my passport , raced back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t recline , on an eight-hour flight .
Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
( Laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize until about a month later .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem .
Whenever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
For your passport , a particular drawer .
For your reading glasses , a particular table .
If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
If these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
Now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! Give me the statin . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don &apos;t like talking about , and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less .
It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
Now , what is this , the NNT ?
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fault , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s the fault of scientists like me .
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
I ran through the numbers myself .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented .
Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol .
Why not , doc ? Give me the prescription anyway . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
And they include terrible things — debilitating muscle and joint pain , gastrointestinal distress — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Five percent , not very likely it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the drug . &quot; &quot; But wait a minute .
300 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s helped , five percent of those 300 have side effects , that &apos;s 15 people .
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
Because you have a choice oftentimes , do you I want a shorter life that &apos;s pain-free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end ?
These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
Face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is expending metabolism on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
At that moment , I started thinking .
Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
How ?
Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know better than them ?
All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
Regardless of the who , how and why .
Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
Does she want to commit suicide ?
&apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
Translate that for me .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
Creativity is the idea .
So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
A baby first identifies its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
It doesn &apos;t work .
People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
I remember well the meals of my childhood .
For community though , we start at the very beginning .
There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .

Hi . I am an architect .
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
But over two million people cut trees .
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
The color coordination is very important .
And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
And they are very kind , affording my model .
I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
So this is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
You can see the bars of the window there .
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
I met him at a 46664 event .
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
They work in the field .
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
So this is my SING Campaign .
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
This can happen .
And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
Thank you very much .

In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
Today , a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I &apos;m &quot; articulate &quot; Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction I don &apos;t even think of it ‘ Cause I ’ m &quot; &quot; articulate &quot; &quot; So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There ’ s no misdirected intention Pay attention ‘ Cause I ’ m “ articulate ” So when my father asks , “ Wha ’ kinda ting is dis ? ” My “ articulate ” answer never goes amiss I say “ father , this is the impending problem at hand ” And when I ’ m on the block I switch it up just because I can
So when my boy says , “ What ’ s good with you son ? ” I just say , “ I jus ’ fall out wit dem people but I done ! ” And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “ Yo ! Why dese books neva be about my peoples ” Yes , I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I ’ m “ articulate ” But who controls articulation ?
Because the English language is a multifaceted oration Subject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I ’ m here to tell you that even “ articulate ” Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says , “ Hello ” I stop him and say “ Noooo … You ’ re being inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘ what ’ s good ’ ” Now you may think that ’ s too hood , that ’ s not cool But I ’ m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mommy mocks me and says “ ya ’ ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store ” I say “ Mommy , no , that sentence is not following the law
Never does the word &quot; &quot; madd &quot; &quot; go before a present participle That ’ s simply the principle of this English ” If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop , From every suburbia , and every hood ‘ Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis Of this world saying “ it is good &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I ’ m too ignorant to teach ‘ Cause I speak three tongues One for each : Home , school and friends I ’ m a tri-lingual orator Sometimes I ’ m consistent with my language now
Then switch it up so I don ’ t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like … I ’ m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can ’ t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history
I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I ’ m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ’ ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I ’ m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity So don ’ t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation
This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That ’ s why I put &quot; &quot; tri-lingual &quot; &quot; on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ’ ll be more than happy to show that I can say : “ What ’ s good ” “ Whatagwan ” And of course … “ Hello ” Because I ’ m “ articulate ” Thank you .

Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . Very significant mark .
And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
I &apos;m performing for you .
Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand .
I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
We run today the world &apos;s largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army .
The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust .
These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
Once all the missing persons are identified , only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain .
In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
We shouldn &apos;t assume that the world of is , of lengths and weights , has the same structure as the world of ought , of what we should do .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
( Applause ) ( Music ) Marco Tempest : When asked about deception , he said this : Announcer : Magic is the only honest profession .
Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women — assuming the women they asked told the truth .
( Laughing ) We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses .
Some people deceive for money .
The first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of papers .
Now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heavier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( Laughter )
That would be the plan .
I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
But then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
So I planned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
This is how the year would go .
So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
No big deal , right ?
But then , the funniest thing happened .
They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours , pulling not one but two all-nighters — humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters — sprinted across campus , dove in slow motion , and got it in just at the deadline .
I thought that was the end of everything .
And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
No , no , it was very , very bad .
Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
I write the blog Wait But Why .
And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
Now , I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
And to test this , I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator , so I could compare them .
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them , but the procrastinator &apos;s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey .
Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
&#91; This is a perfect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; Nope ! &#93; So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the Monkey doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the wheel , and he says , &quot; &quot; Actually , let &apos;s read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding scandal , because I just remembered that that happened .
( Laughter ) Then — ( Laughter ) Then we &apos;re going to go over to the fridge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago .
After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber &apos;s mom .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Sigh ) Now , what is going on here ?
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
He lives entirely in the present moment .
He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only cares about two things : easy and fun .
Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in tribal times .
Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the Rational Decision-Maker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
We can visualize the future .
We can see the big picture .
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time .
But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
And for the procrastinator , that conflict tends to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place that &apos;s entirely out of the Makes Sense circle .
I call it the Dark Playground .
( Laughter ) Now , the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well .
It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely unearned , and the air is filled with guilt , dread , anxiety , self-hatred — all of those good procrastinator feelings .
And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
Well , turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments — someone called the Panic Monster .
( Laughter ) Now , the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time , but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there &apos;s danger of public embarrassment , a career disaster or some other scary consequence .
Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this excitement , the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind .
He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accepted ?
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the Monkey said , &quot; &quot; Totally agree , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India , like 200 feet above the ground , and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
Nothing personal .
There are inherent benefits to this .
It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes .
That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
So part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
I cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
Go and look behind the Mountains .
Something lost behind the mountains .
Lost and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem starts during pregnancy .
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
Video : ( Baby crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
One night , my friend Malte , were camping in the Amazon region .
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
Then came a moment of inspiration .
So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
In this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
The coil then closes the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
The coil , if it works , can save lives .
I returned from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
With my wife and partner , Dr. Alexandra Heath , we started to see patients .
After successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
And , the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition .
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia .
The search started again .
We went back to the drawing board .
After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
For centuries , indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms , and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device .
We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
It seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn &apos;t rust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
As you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
Our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open surgery was necessary .
( Applause ) As doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal — if they do .
This is the child from before , after the procedure .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
From start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
That &apos;s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
Together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
We lost the fear of creating something new .
The path , it &apos;s not easy .
Many obstacles arise all the time .
But we receive strength from our patients .
Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
( Applause . )
Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
We call this value-based healthcare .
On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And they finally agreed .
And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
They will share the information on how to improve .
So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
This is happening in reality .
We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
Thank you .

I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup , you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible .
You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
But if the startup organization is so great , why do so many fail ?
I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school , to high school , when I made solar energy devices , to college , when I made loudspeakers .
And 20 years ago , I started Idealab , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many successes , and many big failures .
We learned a lot from those failures .
So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
I never thought I &apos;d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
So much about a team &apos;s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
The customer is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Then I started looking at the business model .
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
Is the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
Is it early , as in , you &apos;re in advance and you have to educate the world ?
And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies , and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it .
So first , on these Idealab companies , the top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — those all became billion-dollar successes .
And the five companies on the bottom — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we all had high hopes for , but didn &apos;t succeed .
So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
And some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Friendster .
The bottom companies had intense funding , they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
Team and execution came in second , and the idea , the differentiability of the idea , the uniqueness of the idea , that actually came in third .
Well , that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger . &quot;
But one of the reasons it succeeded , aside from a good business model , a good idea , great execution , is the timing .
Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the timing was probably maybe more important .
And then some of our failures .
But timing might matter even more .
And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them .
As I said earlier , I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place .
I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio , and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened otherwise .
The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism .
I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
Now appearances , of course , can be deceptive , and to an extent , this feisty , energetic persona of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer , albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one .
Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
But I was skilled at hiding it , and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to .
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself , and as the first semester ended and the second began , there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen .
I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
Shaken , I left my books on the stairs and hurried home , and there it was again .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
Otherwise , it was neither sinister nor disturbing , although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions , particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible .
Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake , in that I told a friend about the voice , and she was horrified .
A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
Suddenly the voice didn &apos;t seem quite so benign anymore , and when she insisted that I seek medical attention , I duly complied , and which proved to be mistake number two .
I spent some time telling the college G.P.
about what I perceived to be the real problem : anxiety , low self-worth , fears about the future , and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice , upon which he dropped his pen , swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest .
And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
And I always wish , at this point , the voice had said , &quot; She is digging her own grave . &quot;
I was referred to a psychiatrist , who likewise took a grim view of the voice &apos;s presence , subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity .
For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
I &apos;m reading the news at six . &quot; &quot; Now it &apos;s down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she &apos;s a television news broadcaster .
It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
Helplessly and hopelessly , I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions .
They told me , for example , that if I proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set , a kind of labor of Hercules .
It started off quite small , for example , pull out three strands of hair , but gradually it grew more extreme , culminating in commands to harm myself , and a particularly dramatic instruction : &quot; &quot; You see that tutor over there ?
You see that glass of water ?
Well , you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students . &quot; &quot; Which I actually did , and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty .
In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination , verbal abuse , and physical and sexual assault , and I &apos;d been told by my psychiatrist , &quot; &quot; Eleanor , you &apos;d be better off with cancer , because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d been diagnosed , drugged and discarded , and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out .
Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
The fellow survivors , the fellow voice-hearers , the comrades and collaborators ; the mother who never gave up on me , who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took ; the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable , and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give up hope .
I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
But together , they forged a blend of courage , creativity , integrity , and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole .
I used to say that these people saved me , but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and crucially , they helped me to understand something which I &apos;d always suspected : that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems .
Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
Because I &apos;d had such a bad problem with self-injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden , so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork , kind of like picnic ware , and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen .
It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
But a later response , and much more useful , would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words , so when the voices warned me not to leave the house , then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt — because if I was aware of it , then I could do something positive about it — but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn &apos;t need to feel frightened anymore .
I would set boundaries for the voices , and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful , establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
Throughout all of this , what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself , and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I &apos;d never had an opportunity to process or resolve , memories of sexual trauma and abuse , of anger , shame , guilt , low self-worth .
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it , and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly , and as such , it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care .
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
Ten years after the voice first came , I finally graduated , this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given , and one year later , the highest masters , which shall we say isn &apos;t bad for a madwoman .
In fact , one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam , which technically possibly counts as cheating .
( Laughter ) And to be honest , sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well .
As Oscar Wilde has said , the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about .
It also makes you very good at eavesdropping , because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously .
I worked in mental health services , I spoke at conferences , I published book chapters and academic articles , and I argued , and continue to do so , the relevance of the following concept : that an important question in psychiatry shouldn &apos;t be what &apos;s wrong with you but rather what &apos;s happened to you .
And all the while , I listened to my voices , with whom I &apos;d finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion , acceptance and respect towards myself .
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices , and becoming fully aware , for the very first time , that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was .
I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
Together , we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing , supports the needs of individuals who hear voices , and which values them as full citizens .
This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
For me , the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy , fellowship , justice and respect are more than words ; they are convictions and beliefs , and that beliefs can change the world .
In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
And likewise , for survivors of distress and adversity , that we remember we don &apos;t have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us .
We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
The light never goes out .
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
&#91; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history . &#93; &#91; The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain . &#93; This week , there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca .
The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we want an anonymous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the emails , you get to see the exchanges of messages , you get to see the mechanics of how this works , how this operates .
The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies .
There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .
Why should we care about this ?
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
And that affects all of us .
Now , for my organization Global Witness , this exposé has been phenomenal .
We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less coverage of this issue in the United States .
And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren .
This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms .
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
Now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .
These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
This is not just about an individual lawyer who &apos;s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal .
This is about how a system works , that entrenches corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
And in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder .
This may seem like doom and gloom , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be rich and powerful individuals .
But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
And since then , the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe .
One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is lagging behind .
There &apos;s bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate , but it isn &apos;t making as much progress as we &apos;d like to see .
So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
How do people release the documents ?
We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you leaked a few years ago .
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
Light &apos; em all up .
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
CA : So they are well-motivated .
And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
Dangerous troublemaker .
JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with hacker .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
This little boy is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; Daddy , when I grow up , I want to be a former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great blessing as a former president , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe .
And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll mention to begin with .
First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures , holy scriptures , in the Bible , Old Testament , New Testament , Quran and so forth , and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques .
And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very serious problem . It &apos;s ordinarily not addressed .
A number of years ago , in the year 2000 , I had been a Baptist , a Southern Baptist for 70 years — I tell you , I still teach Sunday school every Sunday ; I &apos;ll be teaching this Sunday as well — but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position , a subservient position to men .
So they issued an edict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pastors , deacons in the church , or chaplains in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the Bible , there &apos;s over 30,000 verses in the Bible , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth .
But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
That is an all-pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why should I treat them as equals myself ?
The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
In the United States of America , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison .
When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
And since I left the White House , there &apos;s been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison .
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
We &apos;re in California now , and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty .
If you add that up , that &apos;s 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed .
Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty , because it costs so much . ( Applause ) So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women .
Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s genitalia .
And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
In Egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
Another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with misinterpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there &apos;s nothing in the Quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing .
An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father , the uncle or the brother , but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women .
There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery .
Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
So this is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there &apos;s not a whorehouse in America that &apos;s not known by the local officials , the local policemen , or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth .
And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery , but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted , and — ( Applause ) — prostitution has gone down .
For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model .
In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
The last report I got , there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military — 26,000 .
Only 3,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine , or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command , sexual assaults are taking place , so they do not do it .
About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates , and this is now getting a lot of publicity , partially because of my book , but other things , and so 89 universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault .
The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they &apos;ll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity .
Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
Another thing that &apos;s very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes misinterpreted , but for full-time employment , a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man .
When I became president , the difference was 39 percent .
So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
These are the kind of things that go on .
If you take the Fortune 500 companies , 23 of them have women CEOs , out of 500 , and those CEOs , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other CEOs .
Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
Other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War .
There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not mention , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a damn .
The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when separate but equal had existed .
Racial discrimination , legally , had existed for 100 years , from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States , the Civil War , all the way up to the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights .
But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that racial discrimination was okay , but they stayed quiet , because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs , unique access to jury duty , better schools , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care .
Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against discrimination against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privileged position .
And it &apos;s very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system , the majority of men that control the military system , the majority of men that control the governments of the world , and the majority of men that control the great religions .
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one , and where you come from , Europe and so forth , who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act , need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world .
The average woman in Egypt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth .
But I hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters .
I have 12 grandchildren , four children , and 10 great-grandchildren , and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America , not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country , in having equal rights , and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights .
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
I think now I never was pure .
Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
Redemption , smoke .
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
These are both real objects .
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
The queen does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
And that will have led to specialization .
How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
An example is Tasmania .
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
However , bad things happen .
And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

I started my way around six years ago with ironic self-portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nationalities , genders , and social issues — &#91; &quot; &quot; I am Russian . I sell drugs , guns , porno with kids ! &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Vodka = water . I love vodka ! &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) — using photography as my tool to send a message . &#91; &quot; &quot; Marry me , I need a visa . &quot; &quot; &#93; Today , I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman .
They &apos;re my artifacts , or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid-19th century .
I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story .
This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
He hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be romantic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
You look around at all these museums here .
So this is all of the meta-data information .
But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
I started writing fiction in English .
I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
It was only because of our passports .
But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
Literature has to take us beyond .
When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
( Applause )
If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
Why would that be ?
Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bronze casting .
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
I was mesmerized .
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
Its shape was too complex now .
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
So we had to create it .
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
So we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different , where we see a group of intermediate sounds , which is known as the Japanese &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
( Laughter ) We had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn &apos;t improve your Mandarin skills .
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise .
And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen .
What you see here is the audio result — no learning whatsoever — and the video result — no learning whatsoever .
She &apos;s a six-monther .
As the baby hears a word in her language , the auditory areas light up , and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence , getting the brain coordinated with its different areas , and causality , one brain area causing another to activate .
( Applause )
What is it about my brother &apos;s brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality , so they instead become delusion ?
But on the morning of December 10 , 1996 , I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own .
It &apos;s all about &quot; &quot; right here , right now . &quot; &quot; Our right hemisphere , it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies .
And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s very peculiar . &quot; &quot; And I looked down at my body and I thought , &quot; &quot; Whoa , I &apos;m a weird-looking thing . &quot; &quot; And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality , where I &apos;m the person on the machine having the experience , to some esoteric space where I &apos;m witnessing myself having this experience .
So I get off the machine , and I &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down .
